# To Do

- Make `<title>` dynamic
  - If you have only one station result, put the station name as well as the bike (and dock?) count in the `<title>`

- SQLAlchemy.

- Change marker style/image/icon based on bicycle availability at that station
  - Eventually somehow include representation for electric bikes in the markers
