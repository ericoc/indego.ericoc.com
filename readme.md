# Philadelphia Indego Bicycle Stations

### About

I created this small website using Python Flask and PostgreSQL to take advantage of the 
[Philadelphia RideIndego Bicycle Share](https://www.rideindego.com/) program API.

I created this to familiarize myself and get comfortable with Python, as well as to have a fun personal project to learn from.
My original awareness of the existence of the Philadelphia Bike Share program came about because a bicycle share docking station
was installed on the sidewalk across from my former apartment overnight, and I noticed it one morning.

I discovered that a GeoJSON API existed which provides information about the bicycle and docks available
at each of the 179+ (and growing) stations on the OpenDataPhilly website:
- [https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/bike-share-stations](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/bike-share-stations)

Additionally, I began graphing the data because I was very impressed by [Dr. Randal Olson's](https://www.randalolson.com) blog,
visualizing the data from each station:
- [Visualizing Indego bike share usage patterns in Philadelphia](https://randalolson.com/2015/07/18/visualizing-indego-bike-share-usage-patterns-in-philadelphia/)
- [Analyzing the health of Philadelphia's bike share system](https://randalolson.com/2015/08/15/analyzing-the-health-of-philadelphias-bike-share-system/)
- [Visualizing Indego bike share usage patterns in Philadelphia, Part 2)](https://randalolson.com/2015/09/05/visualizing-indego-bike-share-usage-patterns-in-philadelphia-part-2/)


### API

The API end-point that I make requests to is a GeoJSON file which lists every stations data and can be found here:
- [https://kiosks.bicycletransit.workers.dev/phl](https://kiosks.bicycletransit.workers.dev/phl)

The data is also available in GBFS format here:
- [https://gbfs.bcycle.com/bcycle_indego/gbfs.json](https://gbfs.bcycle.com/bcycle_indego/gbfs.json)

Furthermore, more information, as well as anonymized trip data is available going back since the year 2005 on the Indego website at:
- https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/

#### Data

Since the API end-point returns a very large response (including every station), I have [this cron job](indego.cron)
which stores a complete copy of the HTTPS JSON response from the API every ten (10) minutes in [this PostgreSQL table](indego.sql).
- This prevents a slow page load and response time (i.e. poor performance) on every request to my website
- The unfortunate side effect is that I may be showing stale data, up to ten minutes old, assuming everything is working correctly

I have been storing the data in PostgreSQL since mid-2019 and have over 168,000 rows since that time (as of mid-2022, approx. ~3 years):

```
indego=# select now();
              now
-------------------------------
 2022-07-26 16:23:44.966352+00
(1 row)

indego=# select min(added), max(added), count(added) from indego;
              min              |              max              | count
-------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------
 2019-05-01 01:00:41.994451+00 | 2022-07-26 16:20:07.161944+00 | 168066
(1 row)
```

### Maps

The stations are mapped using their GPS coordinates from the GeoJSON response in combination with the:
- [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)

The button to locate yourself on the map relies upon the JavaScript Geolocation API:
- [https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation/](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation/)
- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)

### Charts

A neat little "Easter Egg" that most probably will not notice (and almost certainly do not need) is:
- If you click on the blocky chart within one of the Google Maps info windows on a map marker,
you should receive a pop-up chart showing available bikes at that station for the past thirty (30) days.
  - You can try it out here:
    * https://indego.ericoc.com/search/3022#3022
    * https://indego.ericoc.com/chart/3022
  - Alternatively, you can even historically chart multiple stations at once:
    * https://indego.ericoc.com/chart/30th

These charts are created using a JavaScript library called [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/).
I was even lucky enough to write a post for the [Highcharts Blog](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/) at:
